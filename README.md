Traditional consulting firms specializing in digital art are mostly located in urban areas with a good reputation for startup companies.
While it is rampant, this creates barrier for people living in towns or country sides to reach them for consultation. That is why we
created DigiArte, an answer to your art inquiries to be analyzed, assessed and discussed with digital artists without leaving your home.


DigiArte is an online digital art consultation platform. The platform is to get the most affordable, convenient and creative digital art services
from professional and licensed digital artists. You can get art documents, easily drafted  for you using video or voice or chat system of your choice
to see what's best for your discussion.
